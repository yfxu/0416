      <h1 class="secondary">The scroll of the <i>Box</i></h1>
      <p class="primary">I am getting old these days. I can't seem to think straight, and I can't remember facts anymore. Even the box which I had cast a seal upon, I cannot remember the password off the top of my head anymore. And so, I need to resort to other methods, such as reinvigorating my memory by writing in this scroll.</p>
      <p class="primary">But scientists say that it's good to keep your brain active when you're old, so I've decided not to write the actual password in here, but force myself to make sense of this surreal, meta paragraph. My challenge is: to figure out the password given nothing else but this virtual scroll.</p>
      <p class="primary">But... juuuuust in case I forget, maybe I should write myself a password hint, like Windows advises when you set up a new user account.</p>
